     <h1> According to a legend, when Goddess Ganga was once agitated and decided to descend from heaven to earth and create havoc, Lord Shiva recieved her on his hair. Lord Shiva's hair locks were so strong that Goddess Ganga became helpless. <BR> 

<br>Lord Shiva then released river Ganga from his locks and after flowing about 253 km from the source, Gaumukh, it travelled down to the plains for the first time at Haridwar. This makes Haridwar the first place where the Holy Ganga touches down from the mountains. <BR>


<br> Har Ki Pauri literally translates to footsteps of God. It is believed that Lord Vishnu visited the Brahmakund in Har Ki Pauri. It is Haridwar's biggest landmark and thousands of devotees visit here to take a bath and attend the famous Ganga aarti which takes place every evening <BR>
 
<br> Haridwar is one of the destinations where Kumbh Mela is held. The other 3 destinations are Nashik, Ujjain, and Allahabad. The Kumbh Mela is held at one of these venues after a gap of 12 years. It is the world's largest gathering and it recently took place in the city. Millions of people visited Haridwar for the festival this year. <BR> 
 <br> Many don't know that Shanti Kunj in Haridwar is the birthplace of all the herbal and Aryuvedic sources. All the ayurvedic medicines which travel through the country and world are developed here. It is also home to Patanjali Yogpeeth, a research institution and yoga institute started by Baba Ramdev.

<H1> It is believed that Mata Vaishno Devi, who was also known as Trikuta observed the ‘Navratra’, to pray for the victory of Lord Rama against Ravana. It is also said that Lord Rama also ensured her that the entire world would sing her praises and revere her as Mata Vaishno Devi. Thus, it is due to Rama’s blessings that Mata Vaishno Devi attained immortality and now attracts thousands of pilgrims to the shrine each year. <br>
<br> Bhairo Nath, who chased Mata Vaishno Devi and pestered her to marry him, was actually sent by Gorakh Nath, who was a Mahayogi. Gorakh Nath had a vision of the conversation between Lord Rama and Vaishnavi. Led by curiosity to know more about Vaishnavi, the Mahayogi sent his prime disciple to collect information about the Goddess. <br>
<br> Mata Vaishno Devi had an Ashram on the foothills of Trikuta. The ashram was constructed on the instructions of Lord Rama, who ensured Vaishnavi to built an ashram where they will live after getting married in the Kaliyug. <br>
<br> The Goddess after forgiving Bhairo Nath and allowing him to attain Moksha shed her human form and took the form of a rock in order to continue uninterrupted meditation. Mata Vaishno Devi, hence, gives her devotees darshan in the form of a five and half feet tall rock, with three pindies or heads on the top. The cave where she transformed herself is now the holy shrine of Vaishno Devi and the pindies form the sanctum sanctorum. <br>
<br> There are many legends for establishment of Mata Vaishno Devi Temple. However, the legend related to Pandit seems most appropriate. It is said that Pandit Sridhar was a poor sage, who had a vision of Mata Vaishno Devi indicating him the route to the temple. It is also believed that whenever Sridhar losts his way, Vaishno Devi appeared in his dream to guide him. <br>

Muhammad Bin Tughluq was the first to visit the Dargah Sharif of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishty Ajmeri in 1332. <BR>
<BR> Jahalra--one of the monuments inside the dargah was once the main source of water during the reign of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty. Even today, water from Jahalra is used for all the rituals performed within the dargah. <BR>
<BR> Every day, after namaaz is offered, “qawwalis” praising Allah are sung by devotional singers inside Ajmer Sharif’s hall, mehfil-e-sama. <BR>
<BR> Nizam Sikka, an ordinary water carrier, once saved Mughal Emperor Humayun’s life. As a reward, he was granted the right to rule the Mughal Empire for a day. The tomb of Nizam Sikka is located inside the Dargah Sharif. <BR>
<BR> Inside the dargah, you’ll find two deghs (pots) that are used for cooking Niaz - a mixture of rice, saffron, nuts, ghee, sugar and dry fruits. The food is cooked at night and distributed to the public as tabarruk (blessing) after the morning prayers. While the small pot cooks 28 mounds (12.7 kg) of rice, the bigger one cooks 70 mounds (31.8 kg) of rice. The circumference of the degh is about 10 feet. <BR>

Records show that Lord Buddha stayed at the sacred site of the Golden Temple for quite some time. In those times, the spot was a lake surrounded by thick forests. Buddha declared this site as an ideal meditation ground for sadhus and saints. <br>
<br> Long before the Golden Temple was built, Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru used to mediate at the holy site. However, the construction of the Sri Haramandir Sahib was initiated by Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru. He also designed the entire architecture of Sri Harmandir Sahib. The construction started in the year 1581 and took almost 8 years to complete. <br>
<br> Golden Temple was named after the outer layer of gold foil that covers the entire temple. After the death of Guru Govind Singh, this gurudwara was constantly attacked and destroyed by the Islamic rulers. In the year 1762, this religious heritage was completely blown away with gunpowder. After the devastation, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, a brave Sikh ruler rebuilt the rich heritage with marble and adorned it with gold. He took over the entire complex and appointed Desa Singh to look after its operation and maintenance. <br>
<br> Baba Deep Singh is one of the most honourable martyrs in the history of India. He vowed to take his last breath at Sri Harmandir Sahib. In 1757, when Amritsar was invaded by Jahan Khan, Baba Deep Singh fought the battle with five thousand men. During the fierce battle, his head was separated from the body. However, he held his head with one hand and gallantly fought with the enemies in order to reach the shrine and die on its floor. <br>
<br> The foundation stone of the auspicious Golden Temple was laid by a famous Sufi saint Mian Mir. This was done to spread a message that this sacred gurudwara is open to all faiths. There are four entrances to the temple which shows openness to all devotees irrespective of caste, creed and religion. <br>
<br> The pool surrounding the Golden Temple is known as the Amrit Sarovar which is considered sacred by the devotees. Before offering prayers, they bath in the holy water of the Sarovar. The Sikhs believe that spiritual possessions can be gained by taking a dip in the holy water of the sacred pool. Earlier, legends used to say that a holy dip in the Amrit Sarovar can cure ailments and disorders. <br>
